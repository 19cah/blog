My name is Carlos Abraham, I love programming, my favorite numbers are 19 & 7, I'm not a huge fan of Football but I love soccer, I play guitar but I don't sing at all, I knew what I wanted to do programming at an early age. My favorite food is soup & Cuban pork, and I broke my two of my left fingers twice.
