### Where to start?.

When we start learing how to code, we all start asking ourselves questions like: where to start?, what programming do I need to start with?, etc.

Well most of the people say that you should start by learing an easy programming language, [Python](https://www.python.org/) can be an that easy to start with, but today I will be showing you a free course that will help you a lot to learn a basics of the art of Computer Science.

Computer Science 50 or just [CS50](https://github.com/CS50), is the Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by [David J. Malan](https://github.com/dmalan), CS50 teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.

Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a certificate.

HarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on [edX](https://edx.org) to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.
