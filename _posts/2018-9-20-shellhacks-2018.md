[ShellHacks](https://shellhacks.net), the FIU School of Computing and Information Sciences ([SCIS](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/)), Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) and Microsoft cosponsored the 2018 fall hackathon which took the University by storm on Friday, September 14, 2018. More than 700 university students from around the world descended on the FIU PG-6 Tech Station to take part in this event.

## Getting started

The conference day started with the registration, a backpack with a cool t-shirt, socks and stickers was given to every attendee.

## Final thoughts

I learnt a lot of things at Shellhacks and I really enjoyed the great atmosphere of the conference. Actually I've met a ton of friendly people!
