##  Why Commit to a [Github](https://github.com) Streak

For many, something has to spark them to want to start a GitHub streak.
Often it’s a challenge from a friend to code every day for a month,or the desire to prove they can do it.
Even if the challenge comes externally, the motivation needs to come from within.
It’s like the classic quote about climbing Mount Everest simply because "It was there."

I [joined Github in 2016](https://github.com/19cah?tab=overview&from=2016-08-01&to=2016-08-31#contribution-joined-github-21347264-2016-08-30)
and it didn't take me to long to start making a daily commit. Sometimes working on projects but other times just to have a cool green profile.

So how did I went from

to

in just seconds?

GitHub streaks are easily spoofed.
Since git, the application upon which GitHub is based, is a distributed system, it relies on timestamps within commits.
Anybody can post-date or pre-date git commits, push them to GitHub, and the contributions graph will reflect the fake commit dates. Without examination, streams were essentially meaningless.

So that's how I decided to automate my commits to have a perfect streak. So I wrote a [bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) script to be able to commit daily.
The project is [open source and hosted on Github](https://github.com/19cah/gh-cheat), you can use it if you want!

## What did I earn doing it? 

**Nothing**, I really didn't gain anything at all having a perfect Github streak profile. But it was cool doing it, so I did it!

When I write code, I always remember the above Linus Torvalds's quote, so when I find somthing cool to do with a computer I do it, and [Gitub Cheat](https://github.com/19cah/gh-cheat) was one of those cool meaningless projects.
